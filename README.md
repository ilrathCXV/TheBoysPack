# Changelog
Version 1.3.2:
- Added the Unofficial Community Patch to the modpack

Version 1.3.1 (initial GitHub upload):
- Fixed Gemstone Weapons mod causing certain item rarity colors from displaying incorrectly
- Fixed settings for Rocket Jumping which would cause some enemies from flying too much (could cause a softlock in certain situations)
- This caused issues with Loot Marker  not recognizing legitimate Legendaries/Pearls/Seraphs, thus not showing up on the minimap when dropped

Version 1.3.0:
- Added Rocket Jumping mod
- Respawning Allies and Enemies added (respawn delay untouched)
- Reduced enemy health pools by ~50% to account for Cryo repalcing Slag in the pack
- rebalanced Cryo as the last selected options were tuned too high
- Stock parts now grant certain bonuses
- Mag Size/Reload Speed Accessories (depending on the weapon type) now grant small ammo regen (look for the original mag/reload bonuses in the item card to know if you have it)
- More weapon replacers were added and slightly tuned/modified
