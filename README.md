# Changelog
Version 1.3.3a:
- Balanced Maya's Passive Immolate mod to no longer apply Slag (has been returned to Fire damage)
- Fixed Cryo's DoT on targets to better reflect that listed on item cards
- Removed Cryo's extra damage to Armor as it invalidated Corrosive
  - To re-iterate: Cryo does regular damage to Flesh and Armor but deals 30% reduced damage to Shields
  - When an enemy is slowed (i.e. "slagged"), they take 300% Melee damage and 200% Critical and Explosive damage
  - Slowed targets have slower movement and their Rate of Fire is slightly decreased

Version 1.3.3:
- Replaced Cracked Sash with a new Pearl shield that grants Team Ammo Regen and user-Rocket regen
- Replaced the Whiskey Tango Foxtrot with The Gundropper (booster shield that has a chance of dropping weapons when damaged)
- Various bugfixes/merging with mods within the pack

Version 1.3.2:
- Added the Unofficial Community Patch to the modpack

Version 1.3.1 (initial GitHub upload):
- Fixed Gemstone Weapons mod causing certain item rarity colors from displaying incorrectly
- Fixed settings for Rocket Jumping which would cause some enemies from flying too much (could cause a softlock in certain situations)
- This caused issues with Loot Marker not recognizing legitimate Legendaries/Pearls/Seraphs, thus not showing up on the minimap when dropped

Version 1.3.0:
- Added Rocket Jumping mod
- Respawning Allies and Enemies added (respawn delay untouched)
- Reduced enemy health pools by ~50% to account for Cryo repalcing Slag in the pack
- rebalanced Cryo as the last selected options were tuned too high
- Stock parts now grant certain bonuses
- Mag Size/Reload Speed Accessories (depending on the weapon type) now grant small ammo regen (look for the original mag/reload bonuses in the item card to know if you have it)
- Accuracy accessory for SMGs has changed into a Double Accessory (x2 projectiles)
- Bandit barrels now act like Anarchy barrels from BL1 (+1 projectiles)
- More weapon replacers were added and slightly tuned/modified
